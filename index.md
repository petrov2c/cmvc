title: Minimum Viable Circle

Minimum Viable Circle

A quiet experiment in not-performing.

Minimum Viable Circle is a small social experiment exploring how little it takes to feel connected in an overwhelming world.

It begins with ten short stories, each inspired by a principle of social minimalism: quiet presence, local resonance, the right to be boring. These aren’t calls to action—they’re just reflections. If one resonates, you can pass it on. Gently. Personally.

There’s no algorithm. No feed. No notifications.

If something about this feels familiar, you’re invited to take a step out of the stream—just long enough to remember you can.

🌱 How it works
	1.	Read a story. If it stays with you, share it.
	2.	If someone you know would resonate, send them the link.
	3.	If you want to support the project, add your email below. That’s it.

No emails are sent until we reach 1,000 signups. When that happens, you’ll get one message asking:

Do you want to get involved?

If yes, you’ll be invited to join a local or online circle.
If no, that’s it. You won’t hear from us again.
